# Summary

**AutoPPTX** is a Python package designed to automate the creation and styling of PowerPoint presentations from structured input data, tailored especially for educational and teaching environments. Built on top of the widely used [`python-pptx`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/) library [@python-pptx], it offers a modular API to dynamically edit `.pptx` templates, facilitating rapid generation of instructional materials.

This package enables educators, trainers, and instructional designers to efficiently produce consistent, data-driven slide decks with minimal manual effort. By automating the replacement and styling of placeholders—text, images, and tables—AutoPPTX supports reproducible and scalable creation of teaching presentations and lecture materials.

# Statement of Need

PowerPoint (`.pptx`) remains the dominant format for educational presentations worldwide, used extensively by teachers, trainers, and academic institutions. However, educators often spend significant time manually updating, formatting, and customizing slides to incorporate new data, lesson plans, and evolving curricula. Unlike LaTeX Beamer, which supports programmatic slide creation primarily for academic publishing, `.pptx` lacks widely accessible and robust automation tools tailored to the diverse and dynamic needs of teaching workflows.

AutoPPTX addresses these challenges by:

- Automating the filling of multiple placeholder types (text, images, tables) within PowerPoint templates, enabling rapid content updates aligned with lesson revisions or student feedback.
- Extracting and applying consistent visual styles—such as fonts, colors, alignments, and layouts—to maintain professional, uniform, and accessible slide decks that adhere to institutional or pedagogical standards.
- Providing both command-line and Python APIs for seamless integration into lesson preparation pipelines, enabling educators to generate personalized or adaptive learning materials at scale.
- Minimizing manual workload and reducing human errors in slide creation, allowing educators to dedicate more time to pedagogy, student engagement, and curriculum development.
- Supporting reproducible and scalable slide generation that facilitates sharing, versioning, and collaborative development of teaching resources across departments and institutions.
- Enhancing accessibility by enabling consistent application of design elements that improve readability and comprehension for diverse learner groups, including those with visual impairments.

By enabling efficient, scalable, and reproducible slide deck generation, AutoPPTX empowers educators and educational content creators to deliver high-quality presentations with greater ease and flexibility. This promotes improved teaching experiences, fosters learner engagement, and supports diverse educational scenarios—from classroom lectures and workshops to online courses and institutional training programs.

# Functionality

AutoPPTX provides the following features:

- **Multi-type placeholder replacement**: Replace titles, text boxes, images, and tables from structured JSON input tailored to educational content.
- **Styling extraction and transfer**: Capture font, alignment, and layout styles from templates and apply them programmatically for consistent appearance.
- **Placeholder detection**: Automatically identify placeholder types (e.g., title, image, table) to support flexible template designs.
- **Modular architecture**: Components are organized into distinct modules for text, image, table handling, type detection, and command-line interface.
- **Developer friendly**: The codebase conforms to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standards and uses [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for formatting, facilitating maintainability.

# Installation

```bash
pip install autopptx
````

# Example Usage

## CLI

```bash
python -m autopptx.core.runner \

    --input ./data/input_data.json \
    --output ./data/output_demo.pptx
```

## Python API

```python
from autopptx.core.runner import main

main(
    template_path="./data/template.pptx",
    input_json="./data/input_data.json",
    output_path="./data/output_demo.pptx",
)
```
