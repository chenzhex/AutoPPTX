# Summary

**AutoPPTX** is a Python package designed to automate the creation and styling of PowerPoint presentations from structured input data, tailored especially for educational and teaching environments. Built on top of the widely used [`python-pptx`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/) library [@python-pptx], it offers a modular API to dynamically edit `.pptx` templates, facilitating rapid generation of instructional materials.

This package enables educators, trainers, and instructional designers to efficiently produce consistent, data-driven slide decks with minimal manual effort. By automating the replacement and styling of placeholders—text, images, and tables—AutoPPTX supports reproducible and scalable creation of teaching presentations and lecture materials.

# Statement of Need

PowerPoint (`.pptx`) remains the dominant format for educational presentations worldwide. However, educators often spend significant time manually updating and styling slides to reflect new data, lesson plans, or curricula. Unlike LaTeX Beamer, which allows programmatic slide creation mainly for academic publishing, `.pptx` lacks robust automation tools tailored for teaching workflows.

AutoPPTX addresses this need by:

- Automating the filling of various placeholder types (text, images, tables) within PowerPoint templates.
- Extracting and applying consistent visual styles such as fonts, colors, and alignments to maintain professional and uniform slide decks.
- Offering both command-line and Python APIs for seamless integration into lesson preparation and educational content pipelines.
- Reducing manual workload and human error in slide generation, thereby allowing educators to focus more on content quality and pedagogy.

By enabling scalable and reproducible slide deck generation, AutoPPTX empowers educators to deliver high-quality presentations with less effort, fostering better teaching experiences and learning outcomes.

# Functionality

AutoPPTX provides the following features:

- **Multi-type placeholder replacement**: Replace titles, text boxes, images, and tables from structured JSON input tailored to educational content.
- **Styling extraction and transfer**: Capture font, alignment, and layout styles from templates and apply them programmatically for consistent appearance.
- **Placeholder detection**: Automatically identify placeholder types (e.g., title, image, table) to support flexible template designs.
- **Modular architecture**: Components are organized into distinct modules for text, image, table handling, type detection, and command-line interface.
- **Developer friendly**: The codebase conforms to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standards and uses [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for formatting, facilitating maintainability.

# Installation

```bash
pip install autopptx
````

# Example Usage

## CLI

```bash
python -m autopptx.core.runner \
    --template ./data/template.pptx \
    --input ./data/input_data.json \
    --output ./data/output_demo.pptx
```

## Python API

```python
from autopptx.core.runner import main

main(
    template_path="./data/template.pptx",
    input_json="./data/input_data.json",
    output_path="./data/output_demo.pptx",
)
```
