# Summary

**AutoPPTX** is a Python package for automating the creation and styling of PowerPoint presentations from structured input data. Built on top of the widely used [`python-pptx`](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/) library [@python-pptx], it provides a streamlined and modular API for dynamically editing `.pptx` templates.

The package supports automated replacement of placeholders with text, images, and tables, and enables consistent styling across slides. AutoPPTX is particularly useful for researchers, analysts, and educators who need to generate reproducible, data-driven slide decks for reporting or presentation.

# Statement of Need

While formats like LaTeX Beamer support programmatic slide generation, `.pptx` remains the de facto standard in business, education, and government. However, automating `.pptx` slides with fine-grained layout control remains a challenge due to the complexity of the format and lack of tooling.

AutoPPTX addresses this gap by:

- Automating content filling for text, image, and table placeholders.
- Extracting and applying consistent visual styles (e.g., fonts, colors, alignments).
- Enabling reproducible slide generation through both Python and command-line interfaces.
- Integrating smoothly into Python-based data pipelines.

By providing a programmatic way to generate clean, styled slides from structured input, AutoPPTX significantly reduces manual workload and promotes consistency.

# Functionality

AutoPPTX offers the following features:

- **Multi-type placeholder replacement**: Replace titles, text boxes, images, and tables from a structured JSON input.
- **Styling extraction and transfer**: Extract font, alignment, and layout styles from template shapes and apply them programmatically.
- **Placeholder detection**: Automatically classify shape types (e.g., title, image, table).
- **Modular architecture**: Organized into separate modules for text, image, table, type detection, and CLI runner.
- **Developer friendly**: Codebase adheres to [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and is formatted using [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/).

# Installation

```bash
pip install autopptx
````

# Example Usage

## CLI

```bash
python -m autopptx.core.runner \
    --template ./data/template.pptx \
    --input ./data/input_data.json \
    --output ./data/output_demo.pptx
```

## Python API

```python
from autopptx.core.runner import main

main(
    template_path="./data/template.pptx",
    input_json="./data/input_data.json",
    output_path="./data/output_demo.pptx",
)
```

# Figures

AutoPPTX also supports visualization of extracted content using utility functions in the `View` module. Example output slides can be previewed in the [project repository](https://github.com/chenzhex/AutoPPTX#readme).
